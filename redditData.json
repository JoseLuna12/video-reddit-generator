We have a Triceratops and a juvenile T. rex locked in combat complete with skin impressions being prepped and studied as we speak. The amount of mummified dinosaurs and dinosaurs with skin/feather impressions only continues to increase. Just last year we discovered that the southern continents were home to a whole brand new radiation of ankylosaurs that are totally distinct from their northern cousins and look like they have Aztec war clubs on their tails. The largest megaraptorid known was also just named and the largest abelisaur known is awaiting publication. Pterosaur fuzz was just confirmed to be feathers, meaning the common ancestor of dinosaurs and pterosaurs was likely fuzzy. We have a whole multi age group of teratophoneus tyrannosaurs that were together in life. The utahraptor block continues to provide insights into the largest known raptors and how they lived, hinting at sociality and also showing us how the animals grew from tiny lizard-bird to hulking ground bear-eagle-dragon (still needs funding btw if anyone is feeling generous look up the utahraptor project). Our knowledge of marine reptiles and pterosaurs are at an all time high and we have been able reconstruct the lives and appearances of both these animals in astonishing detail. Pterosaurs in particular have been discovered to have been one of if not the greatest vertebrate flyers of all time, even better than birds, and had astonishing life cycles with bizarre strategies by our modern standards it\u2019s wild.The future of the past is bright as fuck it\u2019s nearly blinding.Also yes go watch Sir David Attenborough in Prehistoric Planet on Apple\u2019s thing it\u2019s the best window into the past ever put to screen and showcases a lot of what I was talking about above and even more.

Then they showed us some of the more viral videos of theirs. It took all of the dormant acting skills I have to feign polite interest. It probably lasted 10 minutes tops but it was still 10 mins too many.It was sad, really.I remember when MySpace was the platform, but even back then I don\u2019t remember taking the size of my friend list seriously, or thinking of it as proof of my personal or social value. I realize I\u2019m probably in the minority, but I can honestly say that I\u2019ve never cared about how many followers I have or likes I get. My self esteem is shoddy as it is without attaching any perceived value to that sort of thing anyways, lol",

It isn\u2019t from the government or even the voters.Ultimately this is the seed of corruption.Re-election funding causes politicians not to act for their constituents but for whoever offers the most benefit (which usually but not always means funds) in re-election. Thus lobbyists, PACs, large funding groups, big endorsements (NRA), etc. A huge endorsement can mean as much as millions in election financing, and cowering to these groups substantially reduces the power of our votes.Once politicians stop acting for their constituents, all is lost.",

I waited for a while for the fog to lift, but it didn't. So I hiked back down in near zero visibility, trying not to die. Shortly after reaching the bottom the fog cleared.I went back last December. Completely different time of year. This time the fog wasn't that thick - you could see the church from a couple hundred feet away...but the landscape was still cloaked in it and it was impossible to see the dramatic mountains that surround it.But hey, speaking of the Grand Canyon I was actually supposed to go recently. But then I got hit by a car and I missed it. We can't have everything, right? \ud83e\udd37",

Even if he did actually have these experiences and then come out of the coma and tell us about them, he would never say \u201cI talked to god while I was in a coma.\u201d He would say \u201cThe chemicals in my brain did an interesting thing while I was in a coma.\u201dAs it happened, he did live and was able to tell us about his experience. None of it was remotely religious. It was mostly memories of thinking the hospital staff were torturing him.The closest thing he had during the coma was a dream where he saw my wife telling him that my dead sister and my wife\u2019s dead sister were talking in heaven.",

I am non confrontational for the most part, but In any situation I can tell the exact moment I need to start defending myself, once someone puts their hands on you, like a solid shove, is a good indicator the fight has started.

Here's why, the newest megalodon teeth found are 10,000 years old nothing newer. There would be supporting evidence of their existence from whales, scars, carcasses with the correct bite sizes taken out, damage to the bones that could only be done by a megalodon tooth. There is a 0% chance the megalodon is still alive. Also the argument that it's a deep water shark is weak at best, the megalodon was most likely related to the great white and had similar traits which makes it a coastal sharkEdit: also the carbon dating method used to get teeth only 10,000 years old isn't the most accurate method so most likely those teeth are much much older.",
